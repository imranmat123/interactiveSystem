# interactiveSystem
Java program to aid a Holiday Resort ticket office. The program will handle the booking and cancellation of various activities. Students are required to implement a subclass of the ArrayList class, SortedArrayList, and create classes for Activities and Customers. Activities are listed in an input file with the number of available tickets. Customers are also listed in the input file. The program will interactively process transactions, updating ticket availability and customer information. The program should be able to handle incorrect requests and print notes to a file when tickets are not available.



SortedArrayList.java, which contains your SortedArrayList<E> class.
• Activity.java, which contains your Activity class
• Customer.java, which contains your Customer class.
• input.txt, which is the input file for your program (this can be the same as the provided input.txt
file; your program should only read this file in, not change it).
• clerk.txt should contain a record of the clerk’s interactions with the program displayed in the Ter-
minal Window (both what the clerk inputs and what your program prints out; copy and paste this
from the Terminal Window in IntelliJ; your program should not write to this file).
• letters.txt should be the output file created by your program, which contains the letters to customers
from when there are not enough tickets available
